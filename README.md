# Desktop Application for Personalized Mailing System Automation

## Project Overview
The **Desktop Application for Personalized Mailing System Automation** is a user-friendly desktop app built with the **Electron framework** to automate the process of sending personalized emails. Users can create and send emails by typing directly into the app or uploading a template with placeholders. The app supports integrating user data from a CSV file to dynamically fill in placeholders, such as names, to create customized messages. 

Although OAuth authentication is in the applicationâ€™s design, it is currently disabled due to the testing phase. The application allows easy customization with features like adding signatures, inserting images, adjusting text size, and more.

## Features
- **Personalized Email Sending**: Send personalized emails by using placeholders (e.g., `{Name}`) and filling them with data from a CSV file.
- **Email Templates**: Upload an email template with placeholders and automatically fill them using a CSV file.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The intuitive interface allows easy email creation and management with features like text alignment, font size adjustments, and image insertion.
- **Signature Support**: Add customized signatures to your emails.
- **CSV Integration**: Upload a CSV file with names or other details to replace placeholders within the email content.
- **Testing Stage**: OAuth authentication buttons are included but currently disabled as the application is in its testing phase.

## Technologies Used
- **Electron**: Framework for building the desktop application.
- **JavaScript**: Used for the front-end development.
